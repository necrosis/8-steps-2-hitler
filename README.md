###  What is it?
Several weeks ago I had a conversation with my friend about [Reductio ad Hitlerum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_Hitlerum "Reductio ad Hitlerum"). We mentioned, that this is a very old and cheap trick in disputes, and it's so anoing, that it's popularity is so high nowdays. Because everything in this world could be related to Hitler! But how short is this relation?
